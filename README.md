<h1> Travel-Magazine</h1>

<h5>Travel Magazine </h5>is my new project to To demonstrate what I can do and create more work experience 

<h6> Skills used to build this website: </h6>
<ul>
<li> HTML5 </li>
<li> CSS3 </li>
<li> SASS </li>
<li> JAVASCRIPT </li>
<li> JQUERY </li>
<li> Google map API and Twitterr Wedgets </li>
</ul>

<p> Travel Magazine is mobile first responsive which means designing for mobile before designing for desktop or any other device (This will make the page display faster on smaller devices and mobiles). and as the last statistics show that more users view websites on thier mobiles its becoming so important to keep it mobile first. Thankfully CSS3 introduced Media Query which made that possible and easy to be done. </p>

<p style = "background-color: yellow;"> @media only screen and (min-width: 800px)</p>

Instead of changing styles when the width gets smaller than 800px, we should change the design when the width gets larger than 800px. This will make our design Mobile First.


The sticky menu feature added using Jquery to keep the nav menu visible and accessable while visitors browes through the website and all colors, background colors, font types and sizes choosen carefully to allow users to have the best experience UX.

The carousel photo slide made using BootStrap and the zoom in/out for offers pictures feature added using CSS and JQuery.
